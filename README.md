# JavaScript Password Generator Homework Assignment

## What I attempted to do:

Create a password generator that prompts the user to select password criteria, including password length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numeric and special characters. User selections are validated against this criteria and a password is generated and displayed based on the user's selections.
